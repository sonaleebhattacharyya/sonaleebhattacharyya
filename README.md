# 👋 Hi, I'm Sonalee Bhattacharyya

I'm a university lecturer with a strong background in teaching mathematics and a growing passion for **data science**. While continuing my work in higher education, I’m actively building skills and projects in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning.

## 🔍 What I’m Focused On
- Pursuing a **Master’s in Data Science**
- Building a portfolio of **real-world projects** using Python, SQL, and visualization tools
- Exploring applications of **AI and NLP in education**

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebooks
- R (basic)
- Git & GitHub
- Excel, Google Sheets

## 📁 Projects (coming soon)
- **Student Success Dashboard** – analyzing patterns in academic performance and engagement  
- **Savings Plan Simulator** – modeling compound interest and financial planning with Python  
- **Set Theory & Venn Diagrams Curriculum** – a hands-on math enrichment program for middle schoolers  

## 🎯 Why Data Science?
I love teaching people how to make sense of complex ideas. Now, I’m extending that work into the world of data — using evidence and visual storytelling to support smart, ethical decision-making in education, finance, and beyond.
